## What is Rammus?

Rammus is an open-source, public Discord bot programmed in Python 3, with the sole purpose of having as many functions and uses as possible while still maintaining an appropriate level of performance. This is able to be achieved due to the efficiency of the Python language, but the only other reason why Rammus was created in Python is because it's the only language I'm actively proficient at, for the time being.
